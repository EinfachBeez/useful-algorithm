### Number System

#### Decimal to Binary

The system behind is relatively simple. 
To get the binary numbers, you just have to divide the decimal number until you get a result of 0. 
The remainder reflects the binary numbers, but which are read from the last division to the first division.

#### Decimal, hexadecimal and binary conversion table

| Dec | Bin    | Hex |
| --- | ---    | --- |
| 0   | 0      | 0   |
| 1   | 1      | 1   |
| 2   | 10     | 2   |
| 3   | 11     | 3   |
| 4   | 100    | 4   |
| 5   | 101    | 5   |
| 6   | 110    | 6   |
